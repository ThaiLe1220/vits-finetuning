wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_100.wav|10| begins with a pledge to uphold the dignity of the individual,  and our Declaration of Independence proclaims that all  men are created equal.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_101.wav|10| our countries.  Generations have worked to live up to these ideals.  And when he came to India, Martin Luther King, Jr.  was introduced to some schoolchildren,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_102.wav|10| as a fellow untouchable.  My grandfather was a cook for the British Army in Kenya.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_103.wav|10| The distant branches of Michelle's family tree  include both slaves and slave owners.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_104.wav|10| When we were born, people who looked like us still  couldn't vote in some parts of the country.  Even as America has grown, we've been able to
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_105.wav|10| has blessed us with extraordinary opportunities.  There were moments in my life where I've been treated  differently because of the color of my skin.  In many countries, we have to be careful about our
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_106.wav|10| including the United States, grapple with questions of  identity and inequality and how we treat each other,  people who are different than us, how we deal with diversity
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_107.wav|10| of beliefs and of faiths.  Right now, in crowded neighborhoods not far from  here, a man is driving an auto rickshaw or washing  somebody else's clothes or washing somebody else's
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_108.wav|10| doing the hard work no one else will do, and a woman is cleaning somebody else's house,  and a young man is on a bicycle delivering lunch, a little girl is hauling a heavy bag
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_109.wav|10| bucket of water.  And I believe their dreams, their hopes are just as  important, just as beautiful, just as worthy as
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_11.wav|10| I bring the friendship and the greetings of the American people.  On behalf of myself and Michelle, thank you so much for welcoming us back to the
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_110.wav|10| And so even as we live in a world of terrible  inequality, we're also proud to be a part of
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_111.wav|10| to live in countries where even the grandson of a cook  can become President, or even a dulut can help write a  constitution, and even a tea seller can become Prime Minister.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_112.wav|10| Thank you, Mr. President.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_113.wav|10| The point is, is that the aim of our work must be not to just have a few do well, but
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_114.wav|10| But to have everybody have a chance, everybody who's  willing to work for it have the ability to dream big  and then realize it.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_115.wav|10| reach those dreams.  Our nations are strongest when we uphold the equality  of all our people, and that includes our women.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_116.wav|10| Now, you may have noticed I am married to a very strong
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_117.wav|10| talented woman.  Michelle is not afraid to speak her mind or tell me  when I'm wrong, which happens.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_118.wav|10| frequently.  And we have two beautiful daughters, so I'm surrounded  by smart, strong women.  And in raising our girls, we've tried to instill in them
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_119.wav|10| basic values, a sense of compassion for others, and  respect for themselves, and the confidence that they can  go as far as their imaginations and abilities  will carry them.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_120.wav|10| And as part of Michelle's work as First Lady,  she's met with women and girls around the world,  including here in India, to let them know that America  believes in them, too.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_121.wav|10| we're still working to make sure that women and girls  have all the opportunities they deserve,  and that they're treated equally.  And we have some great role models, including here today
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_122.wav|10| the former Speaker of our House of Representatives,  Nancy Pelosi, who was the first woman Speaker of the House  and my great partner.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_123.wav|10| And here in India, it's the wives and the mothers who so often hold families and communities  together.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_124.wav|10| Indian women have shown that they can succeed in every field,  including government, where many of your leaders are women.  And the young women who are here today are part of a new generation
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_125.wav|10| that is making your voice heard and standing up and determined to play your part in India's  progress. And here's what we know. We know from experience that nations are
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_126.wav|10| are more successful when their women are successful.  When girls go to school  This is
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_127.wav|10| This is one of the most direct measures of whether  a nation is going to develop effectively is how  it treats its women.  When a girl goes to school, she's going to be
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_128.wav|10| school, it doesn't just open up her young mind, it benefits all of us, because maybe  someday she'll start her own business, or invent a new technology, or cure a disease.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_129.wav|10| And when women are able to work, families are healthier, and communities are wealthier,  and entire countries are more prosperous.  And when young women are educated, then their children are going to be well-educated.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_130.wav|10| and have more opportunity.  So if nations really want to succeed in today's global  economy, they can't simply ignore the talents
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_131.wav|10| half their people.  And as husbands and fathers and brothers, we have to  step up because every girl's life matters, every  daughter deserves the same chance as our father, and
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_132.wav|10| sons. Every woman should be able to go about her day, to walk the streets or ride the bus,  and be safe and be treated with respect and dignity. She deserves that.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_133.wav|10| And one of the favorite things I've
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_134.wav|10| about this trip for me has been to see all these  incredible Indian women in the armed forces,  including the person who commanded the guard
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_135.wav|10| that greeted me when I arrived.  It's remarkable, and it's a sign of great strength  and great progress.  Our nations are strongest when we see
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_136.wav|10| that we are all God's children, all equal in his eyes  and worthy of his love.  Across our two great countries, we have Hindus and Muslims
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_137.wav|10| of Christians and Sikhs and Jews and Buddhists and  Jans and so many faiths.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_138.wav|10| Remember the wisdom of Gandhiji, who said,  For me, the different religions are beautiful  flowers from the same garden, or they are branches of the same
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_139.wav|10| majestic tree.  Branches of the same majestic tree.  Our freedom of religion is written into our
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_14.wav|10| above us, we celebrated the strength of your  Constitution.  We paid tribute to India's fallen heroes.  In yesterday's parade, we saw the pride and the
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_140.wav|10| founding documents.  It's part of America's very first amendment.  Your Article 25 says that all people are equally entitled
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_141.wav|10| to freedom of conscience, and the right freely to profess, practice, and propagate religion.  In both our countries,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_142.wav|10| In all countries, upholding this fundamental freedom is the responsibility of government,  but it's also the responsibility of every person.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_143.wav|10| In our lives, Michelle and I have been strengthened by our Christian faith.  But there have been times where my faith has been questioned by people who
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_144.wav|10| don't know me.  Or they've said I adhere to a different religion, as if  that were somehow a bad thing.  Around the world, we've seen, in
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_145.wav|10| tolerance and violence and terror perpetrated by those  who profess to be standing up for their faith?
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_146.wav|10| but in fact are betraying it?  No society is immune from the darkest impulses of men.  And too often,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_147.wav|10| Religion has been used to tap into those darker impulses as opposed to the light of God.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_148.wav|10| Three years ago, in our state of Wisconsin, back in  the United States, a man went into a Sikh temple and,  in a terrible act of violence, killed six innocent  people, Americans and Indians.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_149.wav|10| And in that moment of shared grief, our two countries reaffirmed a basic truth, as we  must again today, that every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_15.wav|10| the diversity of this nation, including the daredevils on  their royal enfields, which was very impressive, Secret Service
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_150.wav|10| or to practice no faith at all and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_151.wav|10| The peace we seek in the world begins in human hearts.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_152.wav|10| And it finds its glorious expression when we look beyond any differences in religion  or tribe and rejoice in the beauty of every soul.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_153.wav|10| And nowhere is that more important than India.  Nowhere is it going to be more necessary for that foundational value to be upheld.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_154.wav|10| India will succeed so long as it is not splintered  along the lines of religious faith, so long as it's not
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_155.wav|10| centered along any lines and is unified as one nation.  And it's when all Indians, whatever your faith, go to
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_156.wav|10| and applaud actors like Shah Rukh Khan.  And when you celebrate athletes like Milika Singh or Mary Coleman, and every Indian can
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_157.wav|10| pride in the courage of a humanitarian who liberates  boys and girls from forced labor and exploitation  who's here today, Kailash Sudjati.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_158.wav|10| our most recent winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_159.wav|10| So that's what unifies us.  Do we act with compassion?
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_16.wav|10| does not let me ride motorcycles.  Especially not on my head.  I realize that the sight of an American President
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_160.wav|10| and empathy?  Are we measured by our efforts, by what Dr. King  called the content of our work?
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_161.wav|10| our character, rather than the color of our skin or  the manner in which we worship our God.  In both our countries,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_162.wav|10| in India and in America.  Our diversity is our strength, and we have to  guard against any efforts to divide ourselves.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_163.wav|10| along sectarian lines or any other lines.  And if we do that well, if America shows itself as an example of its diverse
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_164.wav|10| diversity, and yet the capacity to live together  and work together in common effort and common purpose.  If India, as massive as it is, would be able to
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_165.wav|10| So much diversity, so many differences is able to  continually affirm its democracy.  That is an example for every other country on earth.  That's what makes
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_166.wav|10| us world leaders. Not just the size of our economy or the number of  weapons we have, but our ability to show the way in  how we work.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_167.wav|10| together, and how much respect we show each other.  And finally, our nations are strongest when we empower
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_168.wav|10| our young people.  Because ultimately, you're the one who has to break  down these old stereotypes and these old barriers,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_17.wav|10| as your chief guest on Republic Day would once have seemed unimaginable. But my visit  reflects the possibilities of a new moment.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_170.wav|10| what happens to old minds like mine.  I'm getting gray hair now.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_171.wav|10| I was more youthful when I first started this office.  And that's why young people are so important in these
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_172.wav|10| Here in India, most people are under 35 years old.  And India is on track to become the world's most  populous country.  So young Indians like me,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_173.wav|10| like you aren't just going to define the future of this nation, you're going to shape the  world.  Like, young people everywhere, you want to get an education and find a good job and make
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_174.wav|10| and it's not easy.  But in our two countries, it's possible.  Remember, Michelle and I don't come from wealthy  backgrounds or famous families.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_175.wav|10| Our families didn't have a lot of money.  We did have parents and teachers and communities  that cared about us.  And with the help of scholarships and student loans, we were able to attend some of the best
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_176.wav|10| the world. Without that education, we wouldn't be here today. So whether it's in America or here in India or around  the world, we believe young people like you ought
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_177.wav|10| to have every chance to pursue your dreams as well.  So as India builds new community colleges, we'll  link you with our own.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_178.wav|10| own, so more young people graduate with the skills and  training to succeed.  We'll increase collaborations between our  colleges and universities, and help create the next Indian
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_179.wav|10| Institute of Technology.  We'll encourage young entrepreneurs who want to  start a business. And we'll increase exchanges, because I want  more American students coming to India.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_18.wav|10| As I've said many times, I believe that the relationship between India and the United  States can be one of the defining partnerships of the century. When I spoke to your
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_180.wav|10| and more Indian students coming to America. And that way we can learn from each other and we can
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_181.wav|10| further.  Because one other thing we have in common, Indians and Americans are some of the hardest  working people on Earth.  And I've seen that.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_182.wav|10| Michelle and I have seen that in a family here in India.  I just want to tell you a quick story.  On our last visit here,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_184.wav|10| We met their children and their families as well,  and some wonderful young children with bright smiles,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_185.wav|10| sparks in their eyes.  And one of the children we met was a boy named Vishal.  And today, Vishal is 16 years old, and he
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_186.wav|10| He and his family live in South Delhi in the village of  Morbon.  This is Vishal.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_187.wav|10| And his mother works hard in their modest home, and his  sister is now in university.  She wants to become a teacher.  His brother is a construction worker,  earning his daily wage.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_188.wav|10| And his father works as a stone layer farther away,  but sends home what little he makes so Vishal can go to school.  And Vishal loves math, and mostly,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_189.wav|10| he studies.  And when he's not studying, he likes watching Kibbutz.  And he dreams of someday
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_19.wav|10| After Parliament on my last visit, I laid out my vision  for how our two nations can build that partnership.  And today I want to speak directly to you, the people of India,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_190.wav|10| joining the Indian Armed Forces.  And we're grateful that Vishal and his family joined us today.  We're very proud of him because he's an example of
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_191.wav|10| talent that's here.  And then Vishal's dreams are as important as Malia  and Sasha's dreams, our daughters.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_192.wav|10| the same opportunities.  Sisters and brothers of India, we are not perfect  countries.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_193.wav|10| And we've known tragedy and we've known triumph.  We're home to glittering skyscrapers, but also  terrible poverty.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_194.wav|10| and new wealth, but also rising inequality.  We have many challenges in front of us.  But the reason I stand here today and am so
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_195.wav|10| optimistic about our future together is that despite our imperfections, our two nations  possess the keys to progress in the century ahead.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_196.wav|10| We vote in free elections.  We work and we build and we innovate.  We lift up the least among us.  We reach for heights
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_197.wav|10| previous generations could not even imagine.  We respect human rights and human dignity, and it is
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_198.wav|10| recorded in our constitutions, and we keep striving to live up to those ideals put to  paper all those years ago. And we do these things because they make our lives better.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_199.wav|10| better and safer and more prosperous, but we also do  them because our moral imaginations extend beyond  the limits of our own lives.  And we believe that the circumstances that we face
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_2.wav|10| And in that moment of shared grief, our two countries reaffirmed a basic truth, as we  must again today, that every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_20.wav|10| what I believe we can achieve together and how we can do it.  My commitment to a new chapter between our countries flows from the deep friendship
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_200.wav|10| circumstances of our birth need not dictate the arc of our lives.  We believe in the father working far from home, sending money back
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_201.wav|10| so his family might have a better life.  We believe in the mother who goes without so that her  children might have something more.  We believe in the laborer earning his
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_202.wav|10| daily wage and the student pursuing her degree.  We believe in a young boy who knows that if he just  keeps studying, if he's just given the chance, his hopes
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_204.wav|10| majestic tree.  And I am the first American President to come to your  country twice, but I predict I will not be the last.  Because as Americans, we believe in the promise of India.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_205.wav|10| We believe in the people of India.  We are proud to be your friend.  We are proud to be your partner as you build the country of your dreams.  Jayhan.  Jayhan.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_206.wav|10| Thank you.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_21.wav|10| between our people.  Michelle and I have felt it ourselves.  I recognized India with the first state visit of my presidency.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_22.wav|10| where we also danced to some pretty good Bhangra.  For the first time, we brought Diwali to the White House.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_23.wav|10| On our last celebration here, we will be celebrating
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_24.wav|10| we celebrated the Festival of Lights in Mumbai.  We danced with some children.  Unfortunately, we were not able to schedule any dancing this  visit.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_25.wav|10| Senorita, bode bode, deshome.  You know what I mean.  So...
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_26.wav|10| Everybody said, by the way, how much better
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_27.wav|10| a dancer Michelle was than me, which hurt my feelings a little bit.  On a more personal level, India represents an
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_28.wav|10| intersection of two men who've always inspired me.  When Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was protesting racial
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_29.wav|10| segregation in the United States.  He said that his guiding light was Mahatma Gandhi.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_3.wav|10| or to practice no faith at all and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination.  Thank you so much.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_30.wav|10| came to India, he said that being here in Gandhi's land  reaffirmed his conviction that in the struggle for  justice and human dignity, the most potent
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_31.wav|10| weapon of all is nonviolent resistance.  And those two great souls are why we can gather here today
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_32.wav|10| Indians and Americans equal and free.  There's another link that binds us.  More than 100 years ago,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_33.wav|10| America welcomed a son of India, Swami Vivekananda.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_34.wav|10| Swami Vivekananda helped bring Hinduism and yoga  to our country.  And he came to my hometown of Chicago, and there,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_35.wav|10| had a great gathering of religious leaders.  He spoke of his faith and the divinity in every soul  and the purity of love, and he began his speech with a
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_36.wav|10| simple greeting, sisters and brothers of America.  So today, let me say sisters and brothers of India.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_37.wav|10| My confidence in what our nations can achieve together is rooted
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_38.wav|10| in the values that we share, or we may have our  different histories and speak different languages.  But when we look at each other, we see a reflection
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_39.wav|10| Having thrown off colonialism, we created  constitutions that began with the three same words  � we the people.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_4.wav|10| Thank you so much, Neha, for what a wonderful introduction.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_40.wav|10| As societies that celebrate knowledge and innovation, we transformed ourselves into  high-tech hubs of the global economy.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_41.wav|10| Together, we unlock new discoveries, from the  particles of creation to outer space.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_42.wav|10| We are among the few nations to have gone to both the moon and to Mars.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_43.wav|10| And here in India, this dynamism has resulted in a  stunning achievement.  You've lifted countless millions from poverty and  built one of the world's largest middle classes.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_44.wav|10| And nobody embodies this progress and this sense of  possibility more than our young people.  Empowered by technology, you are connecting and collaborating
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_45.wav|10| like never before on Facebook and WhatsApp and Twitter.  And chances are you're talking to someone in America, your friends,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_46.wav|10| or your cousins, the United States has the largest Indian diaspora in the world, including  some 3 million proud Indian Americans.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_47.wav|10| And they make America stronger, and they tie us together.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_48.wav|10| family and friendship that allow us to share in each  other's success.  So for all these reasons, India and the United States  are not just natural friends.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_49.wav|10| partners. I believe America can be India's best partner. I believe that.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_5.wav|10| Everybody, please have a seat. Nothing fills me with more hope than when I hear
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_50.wav|10| Of course, only Indians can decide India's role in the world.  But I'm here because I'm absolutely convinced that both our peoples will have more jobs and  opportunity.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_51.wav|10| and our nations will be more secure, and the world will be safer  and a more just place when our two democracies, the world's
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_52.wav|10| democracy, and the world's oldest democracy stand  together.  I believe that.  So here in New Delhi,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_53.wav|10| Prime Minister Modi and I have begun this work anew,  and here's what I think we can do together.  America wants to be your partner as you lift up the lives
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_54.wav|10| of the Indian people and provide greater opportunity.  So working together, we're giving farmers new techniques  and data from our satellites to their cell phones to increase
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_55.wav|10| yields and boost incomes.  We're joining you in your effort to empower every  Indian with a bank account.  And with the breakthroughs we achieved
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_56.wav|10| on this visit, we can finally move toward fully implementing our civil nuclear agreement,  which will mean more reliable electricity for Indians and cleaner, non-carbon
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_57.wav|10| energy that helps fight climate change.  And I don't  have to describe for you what more
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_58.wav|10| electricity means.  Students being able to study at night.  Businesses being able to stay open longer and hire  more workers.  Farmers being able to work at home.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_59.wav|10| able to use mechanized tools that increase their productivity. Whole communities seeing  more prosperity. In recent years, India has lifted more people
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_6.wav|10| incredible young people like Neha and all the outstanding work that she's doing on behalf  of India's youth, and for representing this nation.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_60.wav|10| out of poverty than any other country.  And now we have a historic opportunity, with India leading the way,  to end the injustice of extreme poverty all around the world.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_63.wav|10| As we deliver more energy, more electricity, let's do it with clean, renewable energy like  solar and wind.  And let's put cleaner vehicles on the road.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_64.wav|10| on the road and more filtration systems on farms and villages.  Because every child should be able to drink clean water, and every child should be able  to breathe clean air.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_65.wav|10| We need our young people healthy for their futures.  And we can do it.  We have the technology to do it.  America wants to be your partner.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_66.wav|10| partner in igniting the next wave of Indian growth.  As India pursues more trade and investment, we want to be  first in line.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_67.wav|10| and building new infrastructure � the roads and the airports, the ports, the bullet trains  � to propel India into the future.  We're ready to help.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_68.wav|10| design smart cities that serve citizens better.  And we want to develop more advanced technologies with  India as we do with our closest allies.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_69.wav|10| We believe we can be even closer partners in ensuring our mutual security.  Both our nations have known the anguish of terrorism.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_7.wav|10| nation's energy and its optimism and its idealism,  she makes me very, very proud.  And I'm sure I think that may be her
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_70.wav|10| and we stand united in the defense of our people.  And now we're deepening our defense cooperation  against new challenges.  The United States welcomes a greater role
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_71.wav|10| for India in the Asia Pacific, where the freedom of navigation  must be upheld and disputes must be resolved peacefully.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_72.wav|10| acknowledge the world as it is.  We must never stop working for the world as it should be  a world without nuclear weapons.  That should be a goal for all of us.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_74.wav|10| then our two nations must do more around the world together.  So to ensure international security and peace, multilateral institutions created in the
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_75.wav|10| 20th century have to be updated for the 21st.  And that's why I support a reformed United Nations  Security Council that includes India as a  permanent member.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_77.wav|10| Of course, as I've said before, with power comes responsibility.  In this region, India can play a positive role in
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_78.wav|10| in helping countries forge a better future.  From Burma to Sri Lanka, where today there's new  hope for democracy.  With your experience in elections, you can
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_79.wav|10| help other countries with theirs.  With your expertise in science and medicine, India  can do more around the world to fight disease and  develop new vaccines.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_8.wav|10| Is that somebody related to you?  Okay.  Because we just had a chance to meet, and she's  beaming with pride right now, sitting next to you.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_80.wav|10| and help us end the moral outrage of even a single  child dying from a preventable disease.  Together, we can stand up against human
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_81.wav|10| trafficking, and work to end the scourge of modern-day slavery.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_82.wav|10| And being global partners means confronting the urgent  global challenge of climate change.  With rising seas, melting seas, and rising
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_83.wav|10| melting Himalayan glaciers, more unpredictable monsoons,  cyclones getting stronger.  Few countries will be more affected by a
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_84.wav|10| or planet than India.  The United States recognizes our part in creating this  problem, so we're leading the global effort to combat it.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_85.wav|10| I can say that America's carbon pollution is near its lowest  level in almost two decades.  I know the argument made by some that it's unfair for countries
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_86.wav|10| like the United States to ask developing nations and emerging economies like India to reduce  your dependence on the same fossil fuels that helped power our growth for more than a century.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_87.wav|10| But here's the truth.  Even if countries like the United States curb our  emissions, if countries that are growing rapidly like India, with soaring
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_88.wav|10| energy needs don't also embrace cleaner fuels,  then we don't stand a chance against climate change.  So we welcome India's ambitious targets for
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_89.wav|10| generating more clean energy.  We'll continue to help India deal with the impacts  of climate change, because you shouldn't have to bear  that burden alone.  And as we keep working together,
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_90.wav|10| for a strong global agreement on climate change. It's young people like you who have to speak  up so we can protect this planet for your generation. I'll be gone when I'm out of
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_91.wav|10| when the worst effects happen.  It's your generation and your children that are going to be impacted.  And that's why it's urgent that we begin this work right now.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_92.wav|10| Development that lifts up the lives and health of our people.  Trade and economic partnerships that reduce poverty and create opportunity.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_93.wav|10| Leadership in the world that defends our security and advances human dignity and protects our  planet that's what I believe India and America can do together.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_94.wav|10| So with the rest of my time, I want to discuss how we can do it.  Because in big and diverse societies like ours, progress ultimately depends on the
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_95.wav|10| depends on something more basic, and that is how we  see each other.  And we know from experience what makes nations strong.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_97.wav|10| We are strongest when we see the inherent dignity in every human being.  Look at our countries, the incredible diversity.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_98.wav|10| Even here in this hall, India is defined by countless languages and dialects and every  color and caste and creed, gender and orientations.
wav/obama1/obama1_split_part_99.wav|10| And likewise, in America, we're black and white and Latino and Asian and Indian American  and Native American.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_1.wav|10| Point number one.  When you hear someone longing for the good old days,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_10.wav|10| those moments, those episodes.  In fact, by almost every measure, America is better and the world
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_100.wav|10| who mock the overwhelming consensus of the world's  scientists that human activities and the release of carbon dioxide
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_101.wav|10| methane and other substances are altering our climate in  profound and dangerous ways.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_102.wav|10| A while back, you may have seen a United States senator trotted out a snowball during a floor  speech in the middle of winter as proof that he was
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_103.wav|10| that the world was not warming.  I mean, listen, climate change is not something subject
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_104.wav|10| to political spin.  There is evidence.  There are facts.  We can see it happening right now if we don't act, if we don't roll
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_105.wav|10| If we don't follow through on the progress we made in Paris, the progress we've been  making here at home, your generation will feel the brunt of this catastrophe.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_106.wav|10| So it's up to you to insist upon and shape an informed debate.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_107.wav|10| if Benjamin Franklin had seen that senator with a snowball,  what he would think.  Imagine if your fifth-grade science teacher had seen that.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_108.wav|10| He'd get a D. And he's a senator.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_109.wav|10| Look, I'm not suggesting that cold analysis and hard data are ultimately more important
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_11.wav|10| is better than it was 50 years ago, or 30 years ago, or even eight years ago.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_110.wav|10| in life than passion or faith or love or loyalty,  I am suggesting that those highest expressions  of our humanity can only flourish
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_111.wav|10| When our economy functions well, and proposed budgets add up, and our environment is protected,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_112.wav|10| And to accomplish those things, to make collective decisions  on behalf of a common good, we have to use our heads.  We have to agree that facts and evidence matter.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_113.wav|10| And we've got to hold our leaders and ourselves  accountable to know what the heck they're talking about.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_114.wav|10| Point five.  I only have two more points.  I know it's getting cold and you guys have to graduate.  Point four.  Have faith in democracy.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_115.wav|10| Look, I know it's not always pretty.  Really, I know.  I've been living it.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_116.wav|10| But it's how, bit by bit, generation by generation,  we have made progress in this nation.  That's how we ban child labor, that's how we clean
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_117.wav|10| cleaned up our air and our water.  That's how we passed programs like Social Security and  Medicare that lifted millions of seniors out of poverty.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_118.wav|10| None of these changes happened overnight.  They didn't happen because some charismatic leader got  everybody suddenly to agree on everything.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_119.wav|10| some massive political revolution occurred.  It actually happened over the course of years of advocacy
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_12.wav|10| And by the way, I'm not set aside
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_120.wav|10| and organizing and alliance building and deal making and
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_121.wav|10| changing of public opinion.  It happened because ordinary Americans who cared  participated in the political process.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_122.wav|10| So...  Well, that's nice. I mean, I helped.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_123.wav|10| But look, if you want to change this country for the better,  you've got to start participating.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_124.wav|10| I'll give you an example on a lot of people's minds right now, and that's the growing inequality  in our economy.  Over much of the last century, we've been in a situation where we've been in a situation
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_125.wav|10| we've unleashed the strongest economic engine the world has ever seen. But over the past  few decades, our economy has become more and more unequal. The top 10 percent of the world's
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_126.wav|10| earners now take in half of all income in the U.S.  In the past, it used to be a top CEO made 20 or 30 times the
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_127.wav|10| income of the average worker.  Today, it's 300 times more.  And wages aren't rising fast enough for millions of hard  working families.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_128.wav|10| If we want to reverse those trends,  there are a bunch of policies that would make a real difference.  We could raise the minimum wage.  We could modernize our infrastructure.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_129.wav|10| infrastructure.  We could invest in early childhood education.  We could make college more affordable.  We could close tax loopholes on hedge fund managers and take
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_13.wav|10| 150 years ago, pre-Civil War.  There's a whole bunch of stuff there we could talk about.  Set aside life in the 50s.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_130.wav|10| that money and give tax breaks to help families with  childcare or retirement.  And if we did these things, then we'd have to pay
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_131.wav|10| help to restore the sense that hard work is rewarded,  and we could build an economy that truly works for everybody.  Now, the reason some of these things have not happened
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_132.wav|10| happened, even though the majority of people approved  them, is really simple.  It's not because I wasn't proposing.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_133.wav|10| them.  It wasn't because the facts and the evidence showed they  wouldn't work.  It was because of human nature.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_134.wav|10| chunk of Americans, especially young people, do not vote.  In 2014, voter turnout was the lowest since World War II.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_135.wav|10| fewer than one in five young people showed up to vote.  2014.  And the four who stayed home
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_136.wav|10| determined the course of this country just as much as the  single one who voted, because apathy has consequences.  It determines who our Congress is.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_137.wav|10| It determines what policies they prioritize.  It even, for example, determines whether a really highly  qualified Supreme Court nominee receives the courtesy of a
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_138.wav|10| and a vote in the United States Senate.  And, yes, big money in politics is
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_139.wav|10| huge problem. We've got to reduce its influence. Yes, special interests and lobbyists have  disproportionate access to the corridors of power. But, contrary to the
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_14.wav|10| when women and people of color were systematically excluded from  big chunks of American life. Since I graduated,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_140.wav|10| to what we hear sometimes from both the left as well as the right, the system isn't as  rigged as you think, and it certainly is not as hopeless as you think.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_141.wav|10| Politicians care about being elected, and they  especially care about being reelected.  And if you vote and you elect a majority that  represents your views, you're going to be
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_142.wav|10| choose, you will get what you want.  And if you opt out or stop paying attention, you won't.  It's that simple.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_143.wav|10| not that complicated.  One of the reasons that people don't vote is because  they don't see the changes they were looking for right away.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_144.wav|10| Well, guess what?  None of the great strides in our history happened right away.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_145.wav|10| Marshall and the NAACP decades to win Brown v. Board Education, and then another decade  after that to secure the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_146.wav|10| And it took more time after that for it to start working.  It took a proud daughter in New Jersey to get
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_147.wav|10| years of organizing marches and hunger strikes and protests and  drafting hundreds of pieces of legislation and writing letters  and giving speeches and giving speeches.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_148.wav|10| and working with congressional leaders before she and other suffragists finally helped win  women the right to vote.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_149.wav|10| Each stage along the way required compromise.  Sometimes you took half a loaf.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_15.wav|10| in 1983, which isn't that long ago.  I'm just saying.  Since I graduated,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_150.wav|10| You forged allies.  Sometimes you lost on an issue, and then you came back to fight  another day.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_151.wav|10| how democracy works.  So you've got to be committed to participating,  not just if you get immediate gratification, but
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_152.wav|10| You've got to be a citizen full-time all the time.  And if participation means voting,  and it means compromise, and organizing,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_153.wav|10| and advocacy.  It also means listening to those who don't agree with you.  I know a couple of years ago, folks,  some folks on this campus got upset that Condoleezza Rice
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_154.wav|10| supposed to speak at a commencement.  Now, I don't think it's a secret that I disagree with  many of the foreign policies of Dr. Rice and the previous  administration.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_155.wav|10| But the notion that this community or the country  would be better served by not hearing from a former  Secretary of State or shutting out what she had to say
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_156.wav|10| say. I believe that's misguided. I don't think that's how democracy works best, when we're not even willing to
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_157.wav|10| listen to each other.  I believe that's misguided.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_158.wav|10| If you disagree with somebody, bring them in and ask them tough questions.  Hold their feet to the fire. Make them defend their positions.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_159.wav|10| If somebody's got a bad or offensive idea, prove it wrong.  Engage it.  Debate it.  Stand up for what you believe in.  Don't be scared to take somebody's
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_16.wav|10| Crime rates, teenage pregnancy, the share of  Americans living in poverty, they're all down.  The share of Americans with
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_160.wav|10| Don't feel like you've got to shut your ears off because you're too fragile and somebody  might offend your sensibilities.  Go at them.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_161.wav|10| if they're not making any sense.  Use your logic and reason and words and by
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_162.wav|10| doing so, you'll strengthen your own position and you'll hone your arguments.  And maybe you'll learn something and realize you don't know everything, and you may
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_163.wav|10| have a new understanding not only about what your  opponents believe, but maybe what you believe.  Either way, you win.  And more importantly, our democracy wins.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_164.wav|10| So, anyway, I know, all right.  That's it, Class of 2016.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_165.wav|10| A few suggestions on how you can change the world.  Except maybe I've got one last suggestion.  Just one.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_166.wav|10| That is, gear yourself for the long haul.  Whatever path you choose, business,  nonprofits, government, education, health care,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_167.wav|10| of the arts.  Whatever it is, you're going to have some setbacks.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_168.wav|10| You will deal occasionally with foolish people.  You will be frustrated.  You'll have a boss that's not great.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_169.wav|10| You won't always get everything you want, at least not as fast as you want it.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_17.wav|10| college educations have gone way up.  Our life expectancy has as well.  Blacks and Latinos have risen up the ranks in business
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_170.wav|10| So you have to stick with it.  You have to be persistent.  And success, however small, however incomplete,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_171.wav|10| Success is still success.  I always tell my daughters, you know, better is good.  It may not be great, perfect,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_172.wav|10| It may not be great, but it's good.  That's how progress happens in societies and in our own lives.  So don't lose hope.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_173.wav|10| if sometimes you hit a roadblock.  Don't lose hope in the face of naysayers.  And certainly don't let resistance make you cynical.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_174.wav|10| Cynicism is so easy, and cynics don't accomplish much.  As a friend of mine who happens to be from New Jersey,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_175.wav|10| a guy named Bruce Springsteen once sang.  They spend their lives waiting for a moment
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_176.wav|10| that just don't come.  Don't let that be you.  Don't waste your time waiting.  And if you doubt,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_177.wav|10| can make a difference.  Look at the impact some of your fellow graduates are  already making.  Look at what Matthew is doing.  Look at somebody like Yasmin Ramadan, who began
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_178.wav|10| organizing anti-bullying assemblies when she was 10  years old to help kids handle bias and discrimination.  And here at Rutgers, helped found the Muslim Public
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_179.wav|10| Council to work with administrators and police to promote inclusion.  Look at somebody like Madison Little, who grew up dealing with some health issues.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_18.wav|10| and politics.  More women are in the workforce.  They're earning more money.  Although it's long past time  that we pass laws
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_180.wav|10| and started wondering what his care would have been like if he  lived someplace else.  And so here at Rutgers, he took charge of a student nonprofit  and worked with folks in Australia and Cambodia and  Uganda to address the problem.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_181.wav|10| the AIDS epidemic.  Our generation has so much energy to adapt and impact  the world, he said.  My peers give me a lot of hope that we'll overcome
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_182.wav|10| overcome the obstacles we face in society.  That's you.  Is it any wonder that I am optimistic?
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_183.wav|10| Throughout our history, a new generation of Americans has  reached up and bent the arc of history in the direction of more
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_184.wav|10| opportunity and more justice.  And Class of 2016, it is your turn now to shape our nation's  destiny as well as your own.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_185.wav|10| Get to work.  Make sure the next 250 years are better than the last.  Good luck. God bless you.  God bless this country you love.  Thank you.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_19.wav|10| to make sure that women are getting the same pay for the same work as men.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_2.wav|10| Take it with a grain of salt.  Take it with a grain of salt.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_20.wav|10| Meanwhile, in the eight years since most of you started high  school, we're all so better off.  You and your fellow graduates are entering the job market
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_21.wav|10| better prospects than any time since 2007.  Twenty million more Americans know the financial security of  health insurance.  We're less dependent on foreign oil.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_22.wav|10| We've doubled the production of clean energy.  We have cut the high school dropout rate.  We've cut the deficit by two-thirds.  Marriage equality is the law of the land.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_23.wav|10| And just as America is better than
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_24.wav|10| the world is better than when I graduated.  Since I graduated, an iron curtain fell.  Apartheid ended.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_25.wav|10| We've virtually eliminated certain diseases like polio.  We've cut extreme poverty drastically.  We've cut infant mortality.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_26.wav|10| by an enormous amount.  Now, I say all these things not to make you complacent.  We've got a bunch of big problems to solve.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_27.wav|10| But I say it to point out that change has been a  constant in our history.  And the reason America is better is because of
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_28.wav|10| Because we didn't look backwards.  We didn't fear the future.  We seized the future and made it our own.  And that's exactly why it's always
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_29.wav|10| There have always been young people like you that have  brought about big change.  Because you don't fear the future.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_3.wav|10| We live in a great nation, and we are rightly proud of our history.  We are beneficiaries of the labor and the grit and the courage of generations who came
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_30.wav|10| my second point.  The world is more interconnected than ever  before, and it's becoming more connected every day.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_31.wav|10| Building walls won't change that.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_32.wav|10| Look, as President my first
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_33.wav|10| responsibility is always the security and prosperity of the United States.  And as citizens, we all rightly put our country first.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_34.wav|10| But if the past two decades have taught us anything, it's that the biggest challenges  we face cannot be solved in isolation.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_35.wav|10| When overseas states start falling apart,  they become breeding grounds for terrorists
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_36.wav|10| and ideologies of nihilism and despair that ultimately can reach our shores.  When developing countries don't have functioning health systems,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_37.wav|10| Epidemics like Zika or Ebola can spread and threaten Americans, too, and the wall won't stop that.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_38.wav|10| If we want to close loopholes that allow large corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid  paying their fair share of taxes, we've got to have the cooperation of other countries
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_39.wav|10| countries in a global financial system to help  enforce financial laws.  The point is, to help ourselves, we need to
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_4.wav|10| But I guess it's part of human nature, especially in  times of change and uncertainty, to want to look
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_40.wav|10| We've got to help others, not pull up the drawbridge and try to keep the world out.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_41.wav|10| And engagement does not just mean deploying our military.  There are times where we must take military action to protect  ourselves and our allies.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_42.wav|10| of, and we are grateful for the men and women who make up the  finest fighting force the world has ever known.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_43.wav|10| But I worry if we think that the entire burden of our engagement with the
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_44.wav|10| The world is up to the 1 percent who serve in our military.  And the rest of us can just sit back and do nothing.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_45.wav|10| shoulder of the entire burden. Engagement means using all the levers of our national  power and rallying the world to take on our shared challenges.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_46.wav|10| You look at something like trade, for example.  We live in an age of global supply chains and cargo ships  that crisscross oceans, and online commerce
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_47.wav|10| They can render borders obsolete.  And a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the  way globalization has progressed.  That's one of the changes that's been taking place.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_48.wav|10| jobs shipped overseas, trade deals that sometimes put workers and businesses at a disadvantage.  But the answer isn't to stop trading with other countries.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_49.wav|10| In this global economy, that's not even possible.  The answer is to do trade the right way by negotiating with  other countries so that they raise their labor standards and  their environmental standards.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_5.wav|10| and longed for some imaginary past when everything worked and  the economy hummed and all politicians were wise and every
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_50.wav|10| standards, and we make sure they don't impose unfair  tariffs on American goods or steal American intellectual  property, that's how we make sure that international
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_51.wav|10| And our congressional rules are consistent with our values,  including human rights.  And ultimately, that's how we help raise wages here in  America.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_52.wav|10| our workers compete on a level playing field.  Building walls won't do that.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_53.wav|10| It won't boost our economy, and it won't enhance our security  either.  Isolating or disparaging Muslims, suggesting that they should be
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_54.wav|10| treated differently when it comes to entering this country.  That is not just a betrayal of our values.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_55.wav|10| That's not just a betrayal of who we are.  It would alienate the very people who are
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_56.wav|10| communities at home and abroad who are our most important  partners in the fight against violent extremism.  Suggesting that we can build an endless wall along our
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_57.wav|10| borders and blame our challenges on immigrants,  that doesn't just run counter to our history.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_58.wav|10| history as the world's melting pot, it contradicts the evidence  that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has  always been spurred by the
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_59.wav|10| by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe.  That's how we became America.  Why would we want to stop it now?
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_6.wav|10| was well-mannered and America pretty much did whatever it wanted around the world.  Guess what?  It ain't something.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_60.wav|10| Applaus
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_61.wav|10| Can't do it.  Which brings me to my third point.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_62.wav|10| Facts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_63.wav|10| of science. These are good things. These are qualities  you want in people making policy. These are qualities
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_64.wav|10| you want to continue to cultivate in yourselves as citizens.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_65.wav|10| That might seem obvious.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_66.wav|10| That's why we honor Bill Moyers or Dr. Bernal.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_67.wav|10| we traditionally have valued those things.  But if you were listening to today's political debate,  you might wonder
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_68.wav|10| where this strain of anti-intellectualism came from.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_69.wav|10| So, class of 2016, let me be as clear as I can be.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_7.wav|10| The good old days weren't all that good.  Yes, there have been some stretches in our history where
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_70.wav|10| In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_71.wav|10| It's not cool to not know what you're talking about.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_72.wav|10| That's not keeping it real or telling it like it is.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_73.wav|10| That's not challenging political correctness.  That's just not knowing what you're talking about.  And yet we've become confused about this.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_74.wav|10| Look, our nation's founders Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson they were  born of the Enlightenment.  They sought to escape superstition.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_75.wav|10| and sectarianism and tribalism and know-nothingness.  They believed in rational thought and experimentalism
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_76.wav|10| and the capacity of informed citizens to master our own  fates.  That is embedded in our constitutional design.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_77.wav|10| That spirit informed our inventors and our explorers,  the Edisons and the Wright brothers,  and the George Washington Carvers and the Grace Hoppers,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_78.wav|10| and the Norman Borlaugs and the Steve Jobs.  That's what built this country.  And today, in every phone,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_79.wav|10| in one of your pockets.  We have access to more information than at any time in human history.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_8.wav|10| the economy grew much faster, or when government ran more  smoothly.  There were moments when, immediately after World War
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_80.wav|10| button. But ironically, the flood of information hasn't made us more discerning of the truth.  In some ways, it's just made us more confident.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_81.wav|10| in our ignorance.  We assume whatever is on the web must be true.  We search for the truth.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_82.wav|10| sites that just reinforce our own predispositions.  Opinions masquerade as facts.  The wildest conspiracy theories are the ones that
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_83.wav|10| Conspiracy theories are taken for gospel.  Now, understand, I am sure you've learned during your years of college
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_84.wav|10| And if not, you will learn soon that there are a whole lot of folks who are book smart  and have no common sense.  That's the truth.
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_85.wav|10| You'll meet them if you haven't already.  So the fact that they got a fancy degree
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_86.wav|10| See, you know, you got to talk to them to see whether they know  what they're talking about.  Qualities like kindness and compassion, honesty,
wav/obama2/obama2_split_part_87.wav|10| hard work, they often matter more than technical skills or know-how.  But
